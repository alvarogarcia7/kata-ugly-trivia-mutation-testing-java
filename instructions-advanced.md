Let's use the trivia code base. This repository comes packaged with
totally tested versions, using the Golden Master technique. Pick the language of your choice in 
this repository or contribute another one. In case there is none
you're comfortable with you can always try to do this without tests
using any of the [available languages](https://github.com/caradojo/trivia)

## Procedure
1. Identify a weakness in the design
2. State what the potential bug is **before explaining your solution**. This is important, simply saying another 
solution is better avoids thinking of **why** it is actually better.
3. Explain or refactor the code to show the new design.

The purpose is to experiment with design alternatives, so it is not necessary to refactor to perfection, and it is optional to use tests.
The purpose of first explaining the problem in the design is to make sure that the new design is not just different but also adresses one or more specific problems.
